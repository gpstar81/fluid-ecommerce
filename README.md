Fluid
Michael Rajotte - 2016 June

Fluid is a php/javascript/mysql/bootstrap 3 driven e-commerce website platform. This was never intended to be distributed easily as it was a base I created for building custom e-commerce commissioned sites for clients.

Feel free to use anything from this in your own projects.

Requirements: Basic web server with Composer, Curl, Git, MySQL, csvsql and PHP with JSON, PHP-CURL, PHP-XML, PHP-IMAP PHP-SOAP and PECL intl (for locale) support php-pecl php-intl.
